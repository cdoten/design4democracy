    text: "Building on its long-standing presence in Silicon Valley and its work in the democracy community, the National Democratic Institute (NDI) is leading the initiative to organize the Coalition. NDI is supported in this effort by the International Republican Institute (IRI), as well as the organizations of many of the Advisory Board members. 
	<br> <br> 
	Initial support for the Coalition has been provided by:
    
* <b>The National Endowment for Democracy</b>, to protect the integrity of information in elections

* <b>Facebook</b>, to advance the Coalition formation and launch; provide digital disinformation research; strengthen Coalition engagement in key 2018 global elections; live-stream candidate debates; develop tools and best practices to combat disinformation in upcoming elections; and assess cybersecurity vulnerabilities among democratic political campaigns and organizations

* <b>Twitter</b>, to advance the work of the Coalition as it pertains to elections and civic engagement


    The Coalition is in discussion with a variety of additional donor aid agencies, philanthropic foundations, and tech industry actors regarding partnership with the Coalition. "
