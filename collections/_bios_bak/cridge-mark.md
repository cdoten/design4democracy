Mark joined mySociety in the summer of 2015, replacing original founder Tom Steinberg.

Prior to mySociety, Mark has had a diverse 20-year career in digital encompassing stints as COO at BERG, the technology and design consultancy, and as a senior advisor at Blue State Digital, the team responsible for the digital strategy used in President Obama’s electoral campaigns.

He started out in 1996 working for a small web design agency in Birmingham before setting up glue London, a digital advertising agency in 1999, and going on to become global managing director of Isobar, following glue’s acquisition in 2005.

He has brought all of this experience to help shape the direction of mySociety’s future — by creating even more digital tools that make a difference to the lives of citizens in Britain and around the world.
