NDI is planning a second disinformation event in collaboration with the Mexico National Electoral Institute (Instituto Nacional Electoral, INE) the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics (Centro de Investigacion y Docencias Economicas, CIDE) and the National Autonomous University of Mexico (Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, UNAM). This will follow up on [the forum held in March 2018][link] before the national elections in July, and will review the 2018 electoral process, highlight local efforts that tackled disinformation, and discuss lessons learned for future elections. Similar events are being held with NDI and FGV-DAPP participation in Brazil and Colombia throughout July and August.
