Facebook released statements on their website about two unconnected attempts by foreign governments to influence users or to steal their personal information. The attacks, which began in Russia and Iran, appear unconnected despite their use of similar tactics. [Facebook removed 652 accounts that were traced to Iran state media and others that have been identified as Russian military intelligence][link].
