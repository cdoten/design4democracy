A Portland Communications [survey of influencers shaping Twitter conversations on recent African elections][link] shows that Africa is not immune to fake news, the rise of bots, or external influence on elections. The survey finds that 53% of key influencers came from outside the country holding the election, with many influencers coming from outside the continent. The report also reveals that bots had a major presence in election discourse while politicians had comparatively minor influence on discussions. Details on specific countries are provided.
