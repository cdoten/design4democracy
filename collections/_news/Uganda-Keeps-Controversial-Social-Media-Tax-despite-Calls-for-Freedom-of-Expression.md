The parliament of Uganda temporarily [maintained a controversial tax on social media use][link] despite widespread protests against it. President Museveni, who first introduced the law, has cited the spread of “gossip” as a key reason for its existence. Seen as an attempt at state censorship, the tax has led to a significant drop in social media use in addition to creating new economic burdens for the Ugandan people.
