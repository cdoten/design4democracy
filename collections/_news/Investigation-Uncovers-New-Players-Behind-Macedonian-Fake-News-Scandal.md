A joint [investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP)][link] and partners reveals that Macedoniaâ€™s fake American news industry in Veles was launched by well-known Macedonian attorney Trajche Arsov, not by apolitical teens as previously reported. During the 2016 election, Arsov worked closely with several high-profile American partners to churn out over a hundred fake news websites on social media. Macedonian security agencies are now cooperating with law enforcement in the US and several other European countries to investigate possible ties between Arsov and the recently indicted Russian hackers.
