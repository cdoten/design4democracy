The prevalence of deepfakes, [videos that are manipulated to show fake events][link], is increasing, prompting Rep. Adam B. Schiff (R-FL) and Stephanie Murphy (D-FL) to call for an analysis of the problem and solutions by the intelligence community. In their letter to the Director of National Intelligence, Daniel Coats, they call these videos a national security risk. Social media companiesâ€™ growing focus on stopping disinformation has been encouraged by pressure from Congress and the intelligence community and the lawmakers hope that the same trend will occur for the fight against deepfakes.
