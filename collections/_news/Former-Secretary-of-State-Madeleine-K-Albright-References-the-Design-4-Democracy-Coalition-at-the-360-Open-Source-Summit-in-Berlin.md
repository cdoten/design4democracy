From June 22-23, 2018, the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensics Lab hosted the 360/OS open source summit in Berlin, bringing together journalists, activists, innovators, and leaders from around the world as part of our digital solidarity movement for objective facts and reality — a cornerstone of democracy. The Summit concluded with the Atlantic Council’s tenth annual Freedom Awards, which honored the 64th US Secretary of State, Madeleine K. Albright, for her work to advance the cause of freedom around the world. 

In her remarks at the 360/OS Summit, Secretary Albright referenced the Design 4 Democracy Coalition, noting that “with support from the tech industry, it will bring together key actors in the global democracy community – including political parties across the ideological spectrum, parliamentary monitoring organizations, civic tech partners, and election monitors.  Our aim is to make it easier for these groups to engage and coordinate directly with technology firms, and vice versa.  This will help democracy advocates and practitioners access the latest tools and best practices for responding to disinformation.  And, done right, it will also help the technology community understand and move earlier to resolve democracy-related problems on their platforms.  When stronger advocacy is needed to push technology companies to do what is in the best interest of democracy and the long-term health of their platforms, the coalition will be able to do so through a more coordinated and united front.”  A complete copy of Secretary Albright’s remarks can be found [here][here].
