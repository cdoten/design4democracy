New findings reveal that Russian propagators of disinformation [often posed as local news sources][link] to exploit the American public’s higher levels of trust for local news organizations. Many fake local news Twitter accounts did not actually post false information, opting instead to establish long-term credibility for when they needed to operationalize. These cases further confirm that the Russian-led disinformation campaign has been years in the making.
