On September 12, 2018, members of the Design 4 Democracy Coalition held an off-the-record workshop in Kyiv, Ukraine on emerging threats in disinformation and cybersecurity. Facilitated by NDI, IRI, IFES, and StopFake, the workshop included a range of organizations from civil society, government, technology companies and the cybersecurity community. Following lightning talks and presentations on research findings, participants took part in focused discussions on disinformation and cybersecurity in the lead up to the 2019 elections, as well as potential areas for improved collaboration with technology platforms to counter identified threats.
