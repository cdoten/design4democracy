Vietnam recently [approved a new controversial cybersecurity law][link] regulating technology firms’ use of personal data. The legislation requires that social media firms turn over subscriber information, IP addresses, and account information to the Ministry of Public Security and remove content from their platforms when requested by the government. The legislation also creates formulations for charging citizens for posting “anti-government propaganda” or any material that “incites violence and disturbs public security.”
