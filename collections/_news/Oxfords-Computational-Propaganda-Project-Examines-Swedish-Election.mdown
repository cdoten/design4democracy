The Oxford Internet Institute Computational Propaganda Project found that [the upcoming Swedish election has experienced a high amount of ‘junk news’][link] shared by users on social media sites, second only to that seen in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Some of these fake sites are modeled after reputable news sources, complicating users’ search for truth. Researchers were surprised to learn that eight of the ten most-shared fake news sites were domestic, causing a renewed focus on local actors over international influences.
