On June 8-9, the Verkhovna Rada, Ukraine’s unicameral parliamentary body, hosted a conference to discuss current threats on democracy, which came as a follow-up to the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada's official visit to Moldova in March of this year. The Design 4 Democracy Coalition supported a panel discussion on countering misinformation and cyber threats that featured co-founder of StopFake.org, Margo Gontar.

On June 9, and with support from the European Parliament, the Verhovna Rada (Ukrainian parliament) convened a one-day event titled "Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine: Strengthening the Inter-Parliamentary Component of Regional and Security Cooperation." The event featured the speakers of parliament from the three participating countries, all of which are part of the European Union's Eastern Partnership (EaP). Key participants included members of the European Parliament and secretariat, official delegations from Poland, Lithuania, Georgia, Moldova, and members of the Ukrainian parliament and secretariat. 

Within the context of this event, NDI organized a panel discussion on regional approaches to disinformation. The panel featured Margo Gontar of the Ukrainian civil society organization StopFake; Samantha Bradshaw of the Computational Propaganda Project at the Oxford Internet Institute; Corina Cepoi of Internews in Moldova; Yevhen Mahda of the Institute of World Policy; Dr. Eugene Czolij of the Ukrainian World Congress; and NDI Director for Eurasia Programs Laura Jewett. The panel was moderated by Rebecca Harms, European Parliament Representative from Germany.
