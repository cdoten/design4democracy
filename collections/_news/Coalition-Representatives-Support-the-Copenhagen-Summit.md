Representatives from the Design for Democracy Coalition attended the [Copenhagen Democracy Summit][summit], organized and hosted by the Alliance of Democracies, with the sponsorship of a wide array of organizations including Microsoft, Facebook, the University of Denver, NDI and IRI.  The Summit featured keynote presentations by former Vice President of the United States Joe Biden and former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, as well as panel discussions on the challenges that social media, cybersecurity threats, and emerging synthetic media present for democracy around the world. In advance of the Summit, the Alliance of Democracy convened their Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity, which includes, as members two Coalition Advisory Board members:  Ambassador Eileen Donahoe, Executive Director of the Global Digital Policy Incubator at Stanford University, and Marietje Schaake, Member of the European Parliament. The conference brought together political figures from the democratic world, including current and former heads of government, as well as leading business executives, academic experts, and dissidents. NDI and IRI are also among the partners engaged in supporting the Commissionâ€™s work.
