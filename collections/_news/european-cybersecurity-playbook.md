Supporting partners of the Design 4 Democracy Coalition, the National Democratic Institute (NDI) and the International Republican Institute (IRI), along with the Defending Digital Democracy project (D3P) at Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center, convened at Google’s Belgium office for the public launch of the “[The Cybersecurity Campaign Playbook: European Edition][playbook]” on May 22, 2018. The event featured a series of discussions including D3P Senior Fellows Robby Mook and Matt Rhoades, representatives from Microsoft and Google, European parliamentarians and policymakers, and officials from the Belfer Center, IRI and NDI.

Mook, manager of Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, and Rhoades, manager of Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign, shared Playbook insights drawn from the attempted external interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The playbook provides accessible guidance to confront the threats posed by cyberattacks to the integrity of democratic systems and values. In an effort to share best practices with European partners ahead of the 2019 EU elections, D3P, IRI and NDI joined forces to adapt the U.S. version of the Campaign Playbook for a European audience. D3P, IRI and NDI also launched an international edition of the “[Election Cyber Incident Communications Plan Template][incident-tpl],” which aims to enable political parties, campaigns, and other stakeholders to communicate quickly and effectively in the event of a cybersecurity incident.
