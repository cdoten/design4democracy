A hacking group affiliated with the Russian government and linked to interference in the 2016 election, [APT28, is believed to be behind the creation of six websites that mimic government and public policy groups][link]. The U.S. Senate, International Republican Institute, and the Hudson Institute were among those targeted by the sites, which appear to seek credentials from members of these organizations. Microsoft, which discovered fake websites with domains like my-iri.org and senate.group, has announced plans to fight cybersecurity threats targeting political organizations. The tech company will offer free cybersecurity protections to likely targets of groups like APT28, including campaign offices and candidates, provided that they use Office 365 software.
