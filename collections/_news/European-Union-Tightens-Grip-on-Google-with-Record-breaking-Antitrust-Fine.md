The European Union [issued Google a record-breaking antitrust fine][link] of €4.34 billion ($5.06 billion) over Google’s deals with mobile phone makers and telecommunications operators. According to EU regulators, Google’s contracts with phone makers effectively force those companies to prioritize Google apps and services in exchange for Google providing its Android operating system for free. The fine represents a major step towards stronger government oversight of technology companies, at least in the EU.
